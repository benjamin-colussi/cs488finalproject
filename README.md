# READ ME BRO

## Done:
* set up github repo
* added smallpathtracer.cpp and got it working
* refactored existing renderer from base code
* output single .ppm file
* set up command line loading

## To do:
* dissect smallpathtracer.cpp
* unidirectional path tracing
* use OpenMP for parallelization of main path tracing loop
* set up static scene with atmosphere and moons
* atmospheric scattering
* create test object files in Blender

## Later:
* better OOP - multiple files for classes, separate header/implementation, etc.
* make sure not dividing by 0 in ray tracing - as per feedback on A1
* get rid of jaggies, aliasing in simple shapes like cube and sphere

## Extensions:
* photon mapping
